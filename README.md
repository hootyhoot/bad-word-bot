# bad-word-bot
A bad or good word detector bot that allows you to send a message or image when any user sends a pre defined phrase. Uses a set method to split the message content and compare to word list. I recommend hosting this on something like repl.it and using uptimerobot to keep it running, there are numerous videos on this.
When setting up the replit enter your Discord API into the secrets tab. And any images to send into the main directory
